# Code repository for the CAGI 6 Sickkids challenge

A challenge submission by the [DROPers](https://github.com/gagneurlab/drop).

The team members are: [Julien Gagneur](https://github.com/gagneur), [Christian Mertes](https://github.com/c-mertes), [Ines Scheller](https://github.com/ischeller), [Nicholas H. Smith](https://github.com/nickhsmith), [Vicente A. Yépez](vyepez88).

This is the code repository used to generate the results for our two submissions for the [CAGI 6 Sickkids challenge](https://genomeinterpretation.org/cagi6-sickkids.html). We tackeled the challenge by predicting the molecular events underlying disease from a patient’s genome and transcriptome using variant annotation, aberrant gene expression events, and human phenotype ontology.

The code will be made available to the public as soon as the challenge is closed/finished. The reviewers of the challenge can get access to the code upon request.
